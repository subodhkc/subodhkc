VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - CONTACT FORM FIX
=====================================

ISSUE: Contact form fails to send emails even though RESEND_API_KEY is in .env.local

ROOT CAUSE: Environment variables in local .env.local are NOT automatically synced to Vercel deployment.

SOLUTION - Add Environment Variable in Vercel Dashboard:
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: subodhkc
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add new variable:
   - Key: RESEND_API_KEY
   - Value: re_hvQ3U6r_L59gcyUDf2EoLjQT6UGUhzUX
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development (check all)
5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy your application (Deployments → ... → Redeploy)

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After redeployment, test the contact form on your live site.
Check Vercel deployment logs if issues persist.

OPTIONAL - Custom Domain for Email:
------------------------------------
Currently using: onboarding@resend.dev (Resend test domain)
For production, consider:
1. Verify a custom domain in Resend dashboard
2. Update from: field in app/api/contact/route.ts
3. Example: 'KC Contact <contact@subodhkc.com>'

This will improve email deliverability and professionalism.
