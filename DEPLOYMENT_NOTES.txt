VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - CONTACT FORM FIX
=====================================

ISSUE: Contact form fails to send emails even though RESEND_API_KEY is in .env.local

ROOT CAUSE: Environment variables in local .env.local are NOT automatically synced to Vercel deployment.

SOLUTION - Add Environment Variable in Vercel Dashboard:
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: subodhkc
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add new variable:
   - Key: RESEND_API_KEY
   - Value: re_hvQ3U6r_L59gcyUDf2EoLjQT6UGUhzUX
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development (check all)
5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy your application (Deployments → ... → Redeploy)

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After redeployment, test the contact form on your live site.
Check Vercel deployment logs if issues persist.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If email still fails after adding env variable:

1. Check Vercel Function Logs:
   - Go to Deployments → Select latest deployment → Functions
   - Look for /api/contact logs
   - Check for "Resend API error details" in logs

2. Verify API Key is Active:
   - Login to Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/
   - Check API Keys section
   - Ensure key is not expired or rate-limited

3. Check Resend Sending Limits:
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000 emails/month
   - Using onboarding@resend.dev has stricter limits
   - Consider upgrading or verifying custom domain

4. Test API Key Manually:
   - Use curl or Postman to test Resend API directly
   - Endpoint: POST https://api.resend.com/emails
   - Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

FALLBACK CONTACT METHOD:
-------------------------
Added phone number for urgent inquiries:
- Phone: 682-224-9904 (SMS enabled)
- Displayed prominently on contact page
- Shows after form submission with text prompt

OPTIONAL - Custom Domain for Email:
------------------------------------
Currently using: onboarding@resend.dev (Resend test domain)
For production, consider:
1. Verify a custom domain in Resend dashboard
2. Update from: field in app/api/contact/route.ts
3. Example: 'KC Contact <contact@subodhkc.com>'

This will improve email deliverability and professionalism.
