## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I build AI systems that work at scale—not just in theory, but in production environments serving millions of users under the scrutiny of global regulators.

With 15 years architecting enterprise programs and 5 patent-pending AI compliance frameworks, I've learned that the hardest problems in AI aren't technical—they're organizational. How do you deploy AI across 50+ business units while staying compliant with evolving regulations? How do you manage $50M budgets with 100+ stakeholders across time zones? How do you balance innovation velocity with regulatory requirements?

I've solved these problems at Fortune 50 scale. And I've built frameworks that others can use to do the same.

## WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT

**I've been in the trenches.** I started as a field technician for a government contractor, worked my way through system engineering and analysis roles, built my own business, and now lead AI strategy at a Fortune 50 company. I understand technology from the ground up—not just from the boardroom.

**I build frameworks, not just programs.** The CSM Framework, SKC ResetFrame™, and my 5 patent-pending methodologies aren't academic exercises. They're battle-tested systems born from real-world challenges I've encountered and solved.

**I don't oversell.** If I say a program will take 6 months, it takes 6 months. If I say we can reduce audit time by 60%, we do. My reputation is built on delivery, not promises.

**I believe in leverage.** Whether it's a governance framework that protects millions of users, a program that ships months ahead of schedule, or a mentorship that unlocks someone's potential—the goal is always maximum impact with minimum waste.
