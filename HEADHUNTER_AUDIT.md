## ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **Hero Section - Missing Salary Signal** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Current**: Generic title "AI Compliance Architect"  
**Problem**: Doesn't signal seniority level to recruiters

**FIX IMMEDIATELY**:
```
Current: "AI Compliance Architect | Enterprise Technical Program Manager"
Better: "Senior AI Compliance Architect | Fortune 50 Technical Program Leader"
Best: "VP-Level AI Compliance & Governance Leader | $50M+ Program Portfolio"
```

**Why**: Headhunters search by level. "Senior" and "VP-Level" are keywords.

---

### 2. **Missing "Open to Opportunities" Signal** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem**: No clear indication you're open to new roles

**FIX IMMEDIATELY**:
Add to About page or Homepage:
```
💼 **Currently Exploring**: VP/Director roles in AI Compliance, 
Technical Program Leadership, and Enterprise AI Strategy at 
Fortune 500 companies and Series B+ startups.

📍 **Location**: Open to Remote, Hybrid (Dallas/Austin), or Relocation
💰 **Compensation**: Seeking $250K-$400K+ (base + equity)
```

**Why**: Headhunters need to know you're available and your expectations.

---

### 3. **Contact Page - No Phone Number** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: Only email contact method

**FIX**:
- Add phone number (even if it goes to voicemail)
- Add Calendly link for direct scheduling
- Add "Preferred contact: Email or LinkedIn"

**Why**: Executives expect multiple contact methods. Shows accessibility.

---

### 4. **Missing Executive Summary/Bio** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: No downloadable one-pager for recruiters

**FIX IMMEDIATELY**:
Create "Executive Bio" PDF with:
- 1-page summary
- Key achievements
- Patent portfolio
- Education
- Certifications
- Contact info

Place prominent download button on About page.

**Why**: Recruiters need to share your profile with clients quickly.

---

### 5. **LinkedIn Integration Missing** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: No LinkedIn badge or recommendations visible

**FIX**:
- Add LinkedIn recommendations section
- Show endorsement count
- Display "Featured" posts from LinkedIn

**Why**: Social proof from Fortune 50 colleagues adds credibility.

---

### 6. **Case Studies Too Generic** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: HAIEC platform description lacks specific outcomes

**FIX**:
Add metrics to HAIEC section:
```
❌ "Built comprehensive platform for AI governance"
✅ "Built AI governance platform serving 3 Fortune 500 clients, 
    reducing compliance audit time by 60%, managing $150M+ in AI spend"
```

**Why**: Recruiters need proof of business impact, not just technical capability.

---

**Problem**: No evidence of thought leadership visibility

**FIX**:
Add section:
- Conference talks
- Podcast appearances
- Media mentions
- Webinar recordings

**Why**: Demonstrates industry influence and communication skills.

---

### 8. **No Testimonials/Recommendations** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: No third-party validation

**FIX IMMEDIATELY**:
Add testimonials section with:

- Company name + title
- Specific outcomes mentioned

Example:
```
"Subodh led our $40M AI compliance program with precision. 
His frameworks reduced our audit preparation time from 6 months to 6 weeks."
— VP Engineering, Fortune 50 Technology Company
```

**Why**: Social proof is critical for executive roles.

---

### 9. **Certifications Buried** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
**Problem**: Six Sigma Green Belt mentioned in timeline, not prominent

**FIX**:
Create "Certifications & Education" section:
- Six Sigma Green Belt
- Computer Security certifications
- SSL Understanding
- M.Sc. Engineering & Technology Management
- B.S. Computer & Information Systems Security

**Why**: Certifications are search keywords for recruiters.

---

### 10. **Missing Salary/Compensation Expectations** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem**: Recruiters don't know if you're in their budget

**FIX**:
Add to About page or create "Work With Me" page:
```
**Compensation Expectations**:
